Hello, random intenet person! I am starting a blog! It is mostly going to be about tech, but I might throw in some other stuff too. I am excited to share my thoughts with you all!

A bit about my self: I am a software engineer who loves coding and building things. Professionally, I mainly work with low-level stuff with GPU optimization, system programming, and network communication, but I also makes fun side projects from time to time, such as Android Apps and Websites. If you haven't already, check out my **[portfolio](https://timgu.me)**!

Coding is my passion, but I also enjoy other things like hiking, cooking, and playing video games. 

This blog is going to be a mix of tech stuff, personal thoughts, and maybe some random things I find interesting. I hope you enjoy it!
